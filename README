NAME
    Unicode::Fraction - easy generation of UTF-8 fractions

SYNOPSIS
     use Unicode::Fraction qw(fraction);
     say fraction(1,2); # ½
     say fraction(1,12); # ⅟₁₂
     say fraction(35,48); # ³⁵⁄₄₈

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a simple function to print vulgar fractions in
    UTF-8.

FUNCTIONS
  fraction ($num, $denom)
    Generate a UTF-8 encoding string representing the given fraction, using
    the most compact representation available. The standard Unicode glyphs
    (¼, ½, etc.) are used if possible; failing that, subscripted and
    superscripted numbers are used (with either the '⁄' or '⅟' glyphs).

    Fractions are not normalised, that is, fraction(2,4) is distinct from
    fraction(1,2).
